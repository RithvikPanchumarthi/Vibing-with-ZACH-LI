## Problem Solved
WorkVibe addresses the inefficiency of keyword-based hiring by implementing a weighted 5-10-5 skill hierarchy (High Confidence, Moderate, Aware). This allows for a granular "Match Score" that quantifies a candidate's actual competency against employer requirements, reducing the time-to-hire for specialized roles.
